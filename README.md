# inside-chassidus-scraper
Go through inside chassidus, turn it's structure into json etc.

Note that, for research, make sure javascript is disabled for insidechassidus.com. That
provides an accurate view of what the scraper sees.

# Status
Note that this no longer works. The website I was scraping changed a lot, and everything is in a diffirent place. However, now it's properly using wordpress, and I can get data from the wordpress APIs directly, which is awesome.
This was very useful in it's time, and helped get an app I was working on launched (I'm only now, almost a year after using this, able to use the wordpress APIs), and am grateful to the excellent work of [gcolly](http://go-colly.org/) for making it possible.
Code on!
